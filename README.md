# My First Game - 2D Catch Game

This repository will contain scripts in C# for my very first video game project in Unity. I will not be adding any other files in this repository to keep it focused.

@dbagina, I am a single designer and developer of the game. All artwork has also been created by me.
To create scripts I have been following various video tutorials online that I have been modifying specifically for my project.

## Catch Evolve
> The biggest creature rules the world. Catch smaller creatures and evolve to catch even bigger ones. Become the dominant species.

*Catch Evolve* is a simple catch game where you need to catch falling objects to gaing points that you can spend on evolutions. Become bigger, faster and stronger. But beware of bigger species that can hunt you instead.
