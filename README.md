# 2D Catch Game

This repository will contain scripts in C# for my very first video game project in Unity. I will not be adding any other files in this repository to keep it focused.

@dbagina, I am a single designer and developer of the game. All artwork has also been created by me.
To create scripts I have been following various video tutorials online that I have been modifying specifically for my project.
